This is My Data analysis Portfolio

Project 1: TMDb_Movie_Analysis: Project Overview
> I chose The TMDb Movie Data Set for data analysis. It contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movie Database(TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

> Dropped some values in the revenue and budget which were zeros, removed the duplicate values in the dataset, and also dropped the misssing values to get the data set fixed.

> In the Data Analysis process, I answered the following questions:
- Which movie has the highest vote rate?
- What is the bottom 8 movies by popularity?
- What is the top Six revenue movies?
- What is the effect of the film budget over time in the first 35 years?
