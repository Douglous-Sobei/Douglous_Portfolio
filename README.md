Hi everyone, I'm Douglous Sobei. I am loking for an entry data analyst role to gain proffessional experience.
I'm interested in problem solving through executing projects in which I do thorough investigation, analysis and communication of data to offer the intended solution.
Though not experienced in the field, I have done a number of personal projects which have shappened my skills and the work experience. The following are some of the projects I have implemented successfully:

# [Project 1: TMDb_Movie_Analysis](https://github.com/Douglous-Sobei/TMDb_Movie_Analysis)
## Project Overview
> I chose The TMDb Movie Data Set for data analysis. It contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movie Database(TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

> Dropped some values in the revenue and budget which were zeros, removed the duplicate values in the dataset, and also dropped the misssing values to get the data set fixed.

> In the Data Analysis process, I answered the following questions:
- Which movie has the highest vote rate?
- What is the bottom 8 movies by popularity?

- What is the top Six revenue movies?

# [Project 2: Data_Wrangling](https://github.com/Douglous-Sobei/Data_Wrangling)
## Project Overview
> Data wrangling is an important skill that people working with data have to aquire since the world's data isn't clean. To make our data clean, wrangling is essential. In any case we analyze, visualize, or model our data before wrangling, the outcome could be making mistakes. Therefore, wrangling is the best practice to reach our expections.

> In the project, did the following;
- Got data from an existing file (twitter-archive-enhanced.csv) Reading from csv file using pandas
- Downloaded a file from the internet (image-predictions.tsv) using requests
- Did a query of an API (tweet_json.txt) to get JSON object of all the tweet_ids using Tweepy
- Imported the data into my programming environment (Jupyter Notebook)
- I assessed the visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues and made a documentation
- Fixed the quality and tidiness issues
- Made a copy in file to test the change before applying to the main dataset.
- Made insights and visualizations
> In the insights and visualizations, I anwered the following questions;

- What are most common dogs' names?

- What is the most common dog in this dataset.

- The number of female vs male dogs

# [Project 3: LoanDatafromProsper Data analysis](https://github.com/Douglous-Sobei/LoanDatafromProsper)
## Project Overview
>This project consit of a financial dataset and this is related to the loan, borrowers, lenders, interest rates and stuffs like that. Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. In this dataset, am using the data from the Posper to analyse it and trying to find the pattern in the Prosper data.

> The dataset which consist of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes include original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status and so on.

> In my analysis, I answered some the questions of interest as shown below.
- What is the Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and the Borrower's interest rate for this loan?

- How BorrowerRate & ProsperScore behavior with categorical features?

- What's relationship between Term and the CreditGrade/ProsperRating(s) and ProsperScore ?

- What's most common Employment Status in each Prosper Rating ?

- How The rating and term affect on Borrower APR ?

# [Project 4: Titanic Data Analysi Project](https://github.com/Douglous-Sobei/Titanic_Data_anaysis_project)
## Project Overview
> The Project is about the sinking of the RMS Titanic which is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

> In my project, I did data exploration and analysis in which My main focus was finding out the surviving rate of the people in the ship. I answered the following questions about the dataset:
- Which gender had a better chance of survival ?

- What was the probability of survival for children, men and women?

- Which age group had a better chance of survival?
